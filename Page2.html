                        There's bedlam in the kitchen, as K-pop disruptors Stray Kids wreak delicious havoc on a sterile commercial space. 
                        They dance around wildly, waving stainless steel pots and pans in the air and tossing freshly pressed napkins and 
                        imaginary ingredients with relish and abandon. In the forefront, fiery rapper Changbin serves up his own potent sauce 
                        with a pummeling verse, while dancer Lee Know attempts to stir fry a handful of what appear to be rose petals behind him.
                        A visual manifestation of the heavy bass ostinato that immediately invades the senses.

                        The Korean boy group's latest single boasts a big, brassy hook laced with trap beats and an addicting refrain
                         ("this is our tang, tang, tang, tang," they shout), a recipe that has become their signature dish.
                         A sonic successor to last fall's explosive "Double Knot," the track teems with a tireless energy and their hallmark
                          bravado. 
                          </p>

                        The video imagines the eight members as chefs who confidently concoct their own art from scratch. "Taste so good, everyone 
                        loves it," Han raps, in a mix of Korean and English. "All our dishes taste so strong."The culinary metaphor is laid on thick, 
                        bolstered by a charismatic performance that includes Korean formalities like "네, 손님" (which translates to "yes, sir and ma'am" 
                        in English) and TikTok-certified choreography that incorporates mixing, frying, seasoning, and, most notably, chopping. Hah! Genius right?

                        But for a group that's been cooking up homemade beats and flavorful lyrics in their bedrooms long before their 2018 debut, it's a savory declaration 
                        that feels more than earned. "We just keep on making new things," leader Bang Chan sings, cleansing the palate with a sweet melody. 
                        "Because we're one of a kind." "We tried to not think too much," Bang Chan tells Teen Vogue from Seoul, South Korea, where he's currently huddled in a 
                        room with the other members.

                    From their 2017 pre-debut release “Hellevator” to the latest single, the snarling, trumpeting EDM of “MIROH”, the K-pop group 
                    have made similarly dystopian environs their visual backdrop, where neon and CCTV screens flicker and the 
                    group are hemmed in by skyscrapers, tarmac, and tunnels as they attempt to escape or defy their surroundings.This concept 
                    of attaining freedom is central to the group. The group’s leader, Bang Chan, 
                    handpicked each member for the group from their parent label JYP Entertainment’s roster of trainees, a process unheard of in 
                    K-pop, where that power lies with executives and creative directors.

                    Stray Kids just released ‘All In’, the main single for their first Japanese mini-album with the same name.
                    Following their Japanese debut earlier this year with the release of their album, SKZ2020, Stray Kids are releasing their 
                    first Japanese mini-album very soon. In the last weeks, they released the Japanese version of their iconic songs ‘God’s 
                    Menu‘ and ‘Back Door‘.
